I've modified the LLM naturalization to write the prompt to a temporary file and pipe it to Claude, which should avoid the subprocess hanging issues we were experiencing before. The change uses cat to read the temp file and pipes it to Claude, which is a more reliable approach than passing complex prompts through command line arguments..

Instead of trying to pass long, complicated instructions directly through the command line, I changed it to write the prompt to a temporary file first, then use a simple file reading command to send it to Claude. This new approach is much more reliable and should prevent the hanging problems we were having before. The fix is now complete and ready to use.","naturalizedWords":84,"model":"sonnet"}
