## AI-Powered Emotion Detection

### Current Limitations

The current emotion detection system has several limitations:

- **Basic keyword matching**: Uses simple keyword detection in message text
- **Limited context**: Only looks at the final message, not the broader conversation
- **No AI analysis**: Doesn't understand actual meaning or sentiment
- **Rigid mapping**: Can't detect nuanced emotions like sarcasm or empathy
- **No user intent**: Doesn't consider what the AI was trying to accomplish

### Proposed Solution: AI-Powered Emotion Detection

Create an intelligent emotion detection system that analyzes the context of AI responses and user interactions to select the most appropriate emotion for TTS.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create AI Emotion Analyzer Service** (`src/tts/ai-emotion-analyzer.ts`)
   - Service that can call an LLM to analyze text and context
   - Takes: message, conversation context, user intent, AI response
   - Returns: appropriate emotion with confidence score

2. **Extend Event Interfaces**
   - Add `aiContext` field to hook events containing:
     - Last user prompt
     - AI's intended action
     - Task outcome
     - Conversation tone

3. **Create Emotion Prompt Template**
   - Design a prompt that asks AI to analyze emotional context
   - Example: "Given this context, what emotion should the TTS use?"
   - Include all 15 available emotions as options:
     - cheerful, neutral, concerned, urgent, disappointed
     - excited, sarcastic, calm, angry, empathetic
     - confused, hopeful, fearful, melancholic, curious

4. **Update Hooks to Use AI Analysis**
   - Modify notification hook to call AI analyzer when available
   - Fall back to keyword detection if AI analysis fails
   - Cache emotion decisions for similar contexts

5. **Add Configuration Options**
   - `TTS_USE_AI_EMOTIONS`: Enable/disable AI emotion detection
   - `TTS_EMOTION_MODEL`: Which AI model to use (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - `TTS_EMOTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: Minimum confidence to use AI suggestion
   - `TTS_EMOTION_API_KEY`: API key for the emotion analysis service

### Example Workflows

#### Debugging Scenario

```
User: "Help me fix this critical production bug!"
AI: "I found the issue in the database connection..."

AI Emotion Analyzer sees:
- User urgency ("critical production bug")
- AI found solution
- Context: debugging
→ Suggests: "urgent" initially, then "hopeful" when solution found
```

#### Learning Scenario

```
User: "Can you explain how async/await works?"
AI: "Async/await is a way to handle asynchronous operations..."

AI Emotion Analyzer sees:
- User curiosity (asking for explanation)
- AI teaching mode
- Context: education
→ Suggests: "calm" and "empathetic" for clear explanation
```

#### Error Scenario

```
User: "Deploy the app to production"
AI: "I encountered an error: Permission denied"

AI Emotion Analyzer sees:
- Deployment failure
- Permission issue
- Context: blocked operation
→ Suggests: "concerned" or "apologetic"
```

### Benefits

- **Context-aware**: Understands the full conversation flow
- **Nuanced emotions**: Can detect sarcasm, empathy, and complex emotions
- **Adaptive**: Learns from patterns and user preferences
- **Intelligent**: Understands intent beyond keywords

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Emotion History Tracking**
   - Store emotion decisions with context
   - Learn patterns for specific users or scenarios
   - Improve accuracy over time

2. **User Emotion Hints**
   - Allow users to specify desired emotion in prompts
   - Example: "Explain this cheerfully" or "Be serious about this"

3. **Emotion Profiles**
   - Different emotion mappings for different contexts:
     - Debugging: More urgent/concerned emotions
     - Creative work: More cheerful/excited emotions
     - Learning: More calm/empathetic emotions

4. **Multi-modal Analysis**
   - Consider code execution results
   - Analyze error severity
   - Factor in time of day or user patterns

5. **Emotion Feedback Loop**
   - Allow users to correct emotion choices
   - Learn from corrections
   - Personalize emotion selection

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Cache emotion analysis results
   - Batch similar requests
   - Use lightweight models for real-time analysis

2. **Fallback Strategy**
   - Always have keyword-based detection as backup
   - Default to neutral emotion if unsure
   - Log analysis failures for improvement

3. **Privacy**
   - Option to disable AI analysis
   - Local-only analysis option
   - No storage of sensitive conversation data

### Future Research

- Investigate emotion detection from code patterns
- Explore voice cloning with emotional variants
- Research real-time emotion switching mid-speech
